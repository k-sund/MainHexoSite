TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that provides additional features such as type annotations and interfaces to make the code more reliable and scalable. One of the features that TypeScript provides is enums. Enums allow you to define a set of named constants, which can be assigned to variables or used in switch statements. In this blog post, we will explore TypeScript enums and see how they can be used in your code.

To define an enum in TypeScript, you use the enum keyword followed by the name of the enum and a list of its members. Here's an example:

``` typescript
enum Color {
  Red,
  Green,
  Blue
}
```
``` bash
$ hexo server
```
